### Overview of Approval Authority Matrix

For purchase requests exceeding $50,000, the approval process involves multiple levels of authority. The **Approval Authority Matrix** dictates the approval requirements based on the procurement value.

## Approval Requirements
- Purchase requests between **$25,000 - $100,000** require approval from the **Procurement Director**.
- Purchase requests between **$100,000 - $500,000** require approval from **Senior Management**.
- Purchase requests over **$500,000** require **Executive approval**.

## Step-by-Step Approval Process
1. **Initial Review**: The procurement supervisor reviews the purchase request to ensure it meets the necessary requirements and specifications.
2. **Procurement Manager Approval**: If the purchase request is between **$5,000 - $25,000**, it is sent to the **Procurement Manager** for approval.
3. **Procurement Director Approval**: If the purchase request is between **$25,000 - $100,000**, it is sent to the **Procurement Director** for approval.
4. **Senior Management Approval**: If the purchase request is between **$100,000 - $500,000**, it is sent to **Senior Management** for approval.
5. **Executive Approval**: If the purchase request exceeds **$500,000**, it requires **Executive approval**.

## Key Considerations
- The approval process ensures that purchase requests are thoroughly reviewed and authorized by the appropriate personnel.
- The **Approval Authority Matrix** provides a clear guideline for the approval process based on the procurement value.
- Adhering to this process helps maintain transparency, accountability, and compliance with organizational policies and procedures.",2025-07-01T13:59:25.711743,session_1751357336619_d3ldqretc
