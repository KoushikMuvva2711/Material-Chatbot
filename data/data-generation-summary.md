## Data Integration Notes
- All data is realistic and industry-compliant
- References actual ASTM, ASME, and API standards
- Includes proper material property ranges
- Follows standard procurement workflow practices
- Compatible with LangChain document processing
- Optimized for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Copy all three files to your project's `data/` directory
2. Ensure your `material_chatbot_app.py` points to the correct data path
3. The LangChain DirectoryLoader will automatically process all file formats
4. Test the chatbot with sample material specification queries
5. Verify procurement workflow question responses

## Sample Queries for Testing
- "What are the specifications for ASTM A106 Grade B pipe?"
- "Explain the difference between 316L and 304 stainless steel"
- "What is the procurement workflow for creating a work order?"
- "How do I track a material request from MR to delivery?"
- "What PMI testing is required for Inconel 625?"
- "Show me the approval process for purchase requests over $50,000"

This comprehensive data package provides your material specification identification chatbot with the knowledge base needed to answer expert-level questions about materials, standards, and procurement processes across multiple industries.
