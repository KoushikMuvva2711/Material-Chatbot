# PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES AND WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT

## OVERVIEW OF PROCUREMENT PROCESS

The procurement process is a systematic approach to acquiring materials, equipment, and services required for project execution. This process ensures that all materials meet technical specifications, quality requirements, and are delivered on time and within budget. The procurement workflow consists of several key stages: Work Order (WO) creation, Material Request (MR) processing, Purchase Request (PR) approval, Request for Quotation (RFQ) management, and Purchase Order (PO) execution.

## WORK ORDER (WO) MANAGEMENT

### Work Order Creation Process
Work Orders serve as the foundation for all material procurement activities. Each WO must contain sufficient detail to enable proper material identification and specification.
